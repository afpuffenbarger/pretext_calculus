          <xref ref="def_two_sided_limit"/> says the distance between <m>f(x)</m> and <m>L</m> can be made arbitrarily small
          (<m>\epsilon</m>-small) by making the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>a</m> sufficiently small (<m>\delta</m>-small).
          Or, in terms of intervals, <m>f(x)</m> is guaranteed to be in the open interval <m>(L - \epsilon, L + \epsilon)</m>
          if <m>x</m> is in the open interval <m>(a - \delta, a + \delta)</m> where <m>x \neq a</m>.

      <remark>
        <p>
          <xref ref="def_infinite_limit"/> says that given any arbitrarily large positive number <m>M</m>,
          you can find an even bigger value for <m>f(x)</m> if <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>a</m>.
          Conversely, given any arbitrarily large negative number <m>N</m>,
          you can find an even more negative value for <m>f(x)</m> if <m>x</m> is sufficiently close to <m>a</m>.

          Existence of a limit under <xref ref="thm-limit-existence"/> can fail because either:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Both one-sided limits exist but are different
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                At least one, one-sided limit does not exist (because of an infinite limit or the function oscillates wildly near <m>a</m>)
              </p>

          A continuous process takes place gradually, without interruption or sudden change. Geometrically
          , a continuous function can be thought of as a function whose graph has no breaks/holes and can be drawn without lifting pen from paper.

        <p>Continuity under <xref ref="def-continuity"/> implies:</p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>f(a)</m> is defined (i.e. <m>a</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>)

          <li>

            Types of discontinuities under <xref ref="def-discontinuity"/> include:

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Removable discontinuity - can be removed by redefining <m>f</m> at <m>a</m>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Infinite discontinuity - <m>f</m> increases/decreases without bound near <m>a</m>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Jump discontinuity - <m>f</m> jumps from one value to another near <m>a</m>.
                  </p>

          The long way of showing <m>f</m> satisfies continuity over an interval under <xref ref="def-continuous-on-interval"/> is by showing that if <m>b \lt a \lt c</m>
          where <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are the left and right endpoints of the interval, then:
          <me>\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = f(a)</me> is always true. Then, if the interval is closed, we can show:
          <me>\lim_{{x \to b^+}} f(x) = f(b) \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{{x \to c^-}} f(x) = f(c)</me>
          to verify continuity at the left and right endpoints.

        <p>
          <xref ref="def-continuous-function-operations"/> follows from the corresponding limit laws in <xref ref="sec-section-limit-laws"/>

      </remark>
      <remark>
        <p>
          <xref ref="thm-continuity-inverses"/> follows from the fact that the graph of <m>f^{-1}</m> is
          the graph of <m>f</m> reflected over the line <m>y = x</m>.
          Therefore, if the graph of <m>f</m> has no breaks/holes, then neither does the graph of <m>f^{-1}</m>.

      </remark>
      <remark>
        <p>
          <xref ref="thm-limit-of-function-is-function-of-limit"/> says the limit operator can move through a function symbol 
          if the function is continuous and the limit exists.
        </p>
      </remark>
      <remark>
        <p>
          <xref ref="thm-continuous-function-of-continuous-function"/> says a continuous function of a continuous function is also continuous.
        </p>
      </remark>
      <remark>
        <p>
          <xref ref="thm-intermediate-value-theorem"/> says a continuous function takes on every value between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.
          Geometrically, if the horizontal line <m>y = N</m> is between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>, then graph of <m>f</m> must intersect the graph of
          <m>y = N</m> somewhere. This is particularly useful in root finding (finding zeros) where <m>f(a) \lt 0</m> and <m>f(b) \gt 0</m>.
