        A continuous process takes place gradually, without interruption or sudden change. Geometrically
        , a continuous function can be thought of as a function whose graph has no breaks/holes and can be drawn without lifting pen from paper.

          A function <m>f</m> is <alert>continuous on an interval</alert> if it is continuous at every number in that interval.
          (If <m>f</m> is defined on only one side of an endpoint of the interval, then continuous at the endpoint means
          continuous from the right or continuous from the left).

        The long way of showing <m>f</m> satisfies <xref ref="def-continuous-on-interval"/> is by showing that if <m>b \lt a \lt c</m>
        where <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are the left and right endpoints of the interval, then:
        <me>\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = f(a)</me> is always true. Then, if the interval is closed, we can show:
        <me>\lim_{{x \to b^+}} f(x) = f(b) \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{{x \to c^-}} f(x) = f(c)</me>
        to verify continuity at the left and right endpoints.
